                <h2>The fellowship of the ring</h2>
                <p>The tale begins in the peaceful and idyllic Shire, home to the Hobbits, a small and unassuming folk. The Hobbit Frodo Baggins unexpectedly inherits a mysterious and powerful ring from his eccentric cousin, Bilbo Baggins. Unbeknownst to Frodo, this is the One Ring, forged by the dark lord Sauron to control all other Rings of Power and dominate Middle-earth.
                    
                    Gandalf the Grey, a wise wizard, realizes the peril the ring poses and advises Frodo to leave the Shire. Accompanied by his friends Samwise Gamgee, Meriadoc "Merry" Brandybuck, and Peregrin "Pippin" Took, Frodo sets out on a perilous journey to Rivendell, seeking the counsel of the Elves.
                    
                    On their journey, the group encounters various challenges and dangers, including the pursuit of the mysterious and malevolent Ringwraiths, servants of Sauron. They are joined by Aragorn, a skilled ranger and heir to the throne of Gondor, and together they form the Fellowship of the Ring.
                    
                    In Rivendell, a council is convened to decide the fate of the One Ring. The council consists of representatives from different races: Elves, Men, Dwarves, and Hobbits. It is decided that the only way to destroy the ring is to take it to the fires of Mount Doom in Mordor, where it was forged. Frodo volunteers for this perilous mission, and a diverse group forms the Fellowship to accompany him.
                    
                    The Fellowship includes Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Legolas the Elf, Gimli the Dwarf, Gandalf, and Boromir, a noble warrior from Gondor. Their journey is fraught with challenges, both internal and external. Along the way, they face the treacherous Mines of Moria, the ancient Ents, the mystical Lothlórien, and the betrayal of Boromir.
                    
                    Eventually, the Fellowship fractures. Frodo and Sam choose to continue the quest on their own, guided by the conflicted Gollum, who once possessed the ring. The others face their own trials and tribulations. Frodo and Sam's path leads them into the heart of Mordor, while the rest of the Fellowship must deal with the growing threat of Sauron.
                    
                    "The Fellowship of the Ring" ends with Frodo and Sam venturing deeper into Mordor, realizing the weight of their mission and the challenges that lie ahead. The stage is set for the unfolding of a grand and complex tale of friendship, heroism, and the battle between good and evil.

                <h2>The two towers</h2>
                <p>The tale unfolds with the breaking of the Fellowship of the Ring. Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee continue their journey to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. They are joined by Gollum, who once possessed the ring and becomes both a guide and a source of internal conflict for Frodo.
                    
                    Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli, members of the disbanded Fellowship, join forces with the people of Rohan, a realm of Men. Rohan is under threat from Saruman, a once-wise wizard who has fallen under the influence of Sauron. Saruman has amassed a vast army of Uruk-hai, powerful and corrupted Orcs, with the intent of conquering Rohan.
                    
                    The trio discovers Merry and Pippin, who were captured by the Uruk-hai during the breaking of the Fellowship. The Ents, ancient tree-like beings, intervene in the conflict. Led by Treebeard, the Ents launch an attack on Isengard, Saruman's fortress. They flood Isengard, destroying much of Saruman's power.
                    
                    In the land of Gondor, Frodo's other friends—Boromir's brother Faramir and their father Denethor—face challenges as Sauron's forces continue to grow. Faramir is tempted by the power of the ring, but he resists and allows Frodo and Sam to continue their quest.
                    
                    Back in Rohan, the Battle of Helm's Deep takes place. The people of Rohan, led by King Théoden, are vastly outnumbered, and the situation seems dire. However, the arrival of Gandalf with reinforcements, including the Riders of Rohan, turns the tide of the battle.
                    
                    As the story progresses, Frodo and Sam traverse the treacherous land of Mordor, dealing with Gollum's increasingly erratic behavior. Gollum's obsession with the ring intensifies, creating tension within the group.
                    
                    Frodo and Sam, guided by Gollum, continue their journey into the heart of Mordor. Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and the remaining members of the Fellowship prepare for the challenges ahead. the fate of Middle-earth will be decided.

                <p> The War of the Ring:
                    
                    The story picks up with Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Pippin, and Merry as they rush towards Gondor. The city is under the threat of an imminent attack by Sauron's forces. Denethor, the Steward of Gondor, is struggling with despair and madness. Pippin forms a bond with Gandalf and becomes a Knight of Gondor.
                    
                    Meanwhile, Frodo, Sam, and Gollum are making their way to Mount Doom. Gollum's treacherous nature becomes more apparent, and he continues to sow discord between Frodo and Sam. The journey is fraught with challenges, including encounters with giant spiders and the treacherous terrain of Mordor.
                    
                    The Battle of the Pelennor Fields takes place outside Minas Tirith. It's a massive conflict involving Men, Elves, Dwarves, and the Rohirrim against the forces of Mordor. The Witch-king of Angmar, the chief of the Nazgûl, plays a significant role in the battle. Eowyn and Merry, who is now a squire of Rohan, contribute to a pivotal moment where the Witch-king is defeated.
                    
                    The Return of the King:
                    
                    As the Free Peoples of Middle-earth prepare for the final confrontation, Aragorn seeks to unite Gondor, Rohan, and the other allies. He takes the Paths of the Dead, fulfilling an ancient oath, and brings the Dead Men of Dunharrow to fight for him. Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn's forces gather at the Black Gate to distract Sauron's attention from Frodo's mission.
                    
                    Frodo and Sam, guided by Gollum, reach the slopes of Mount Doom. Frodo is increasingly influenced by the Ring, making Gollum's machinations more dangerous. At the Cracks of Doom, Frodo succumbs to the Ring's power and claims it for himself. Gollum, in a desperate bid to reclaim the Ring, bites off Frodo's finger and falls into the fiery chasm, taking the Ring with him. The Ring is destroyed, and Sauron is defeated.
                    
                    Simultaneously, the Battle of the Black Gate unfolds. The Free Peoples are outnumbered, and it seems all hope is lost. Yet, Frodo's success at Mount Doom weakens Sauron's forces. The Eagles arrive, and the Ringwraiths are vanquished.
                    
                    The story concludes with the aftermath: Aragorn is crowned King of Gondor, marrying Arwen. The hobbits return to the Shire, only to find it under the oppressive rule of Saruman. With the help of the other Free Peoples, they liberate the Shire in the Battle of Bywater. The hobbits return home but are forever changed by their experiences.
